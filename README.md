Extended Release Radar App for Spotify

Are you annoyed that Spotify's Release Radar only shows one song per artist? Are you missing songs or albums by artists you love? Use "Extended Release Radar" to fix this! The application will generate a playlist of every song by every artist you follow released in the last week.

Important notes: This application will generate every song released in the last week by the artists you follow into a playlist called "Extended Release Radar." If you rerun the program, it will override the playlist. You must follow an artist on Spotify for their songs to appear. Songs may be duplicated if you follow two artists featured on the same song, or if the artist releases more than one version of a song (ie. explicit and clean). Also, very occasionally, songs may be missing if the artist is featured weirdly.

I have not provided the Spotify secret code / application code for privacy sake.


Here is how the finished website will look:

Then, after clicking the button above, the playlist will look something like this:
